Suppose we wanted to call a function, what would that look like?

Grammatically it would be a statement production.

statement : ....
          | 'function' ID (INT) block       # functionStatement
          

where ID is the function name, the INT is how many args.

Then the expr rule would get a new production

expr : ...
     | 'call' ID( expr* )

The FunctionNode would have its symbol and an array of Nodes for the
args.
