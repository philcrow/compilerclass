Could the children just use free registers at will,
put their result into a pseudo-register name like outputreg?
Then the parent would reserve a register for that output before calling,
replace 'outputreg' with the reserved register when
the child call returns. Children would return their used registers to
the free stack. Binary ops would need to reserve
for themselves and once for each child (left and right).

At the top of visitProgram, populate a global Stack<String>
with the general purpose register names available.
Anyone who wants one will pop, store until finished with it,
then push.
