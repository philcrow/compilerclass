\chapter{Assembly}

There are many good books about how to generate genuine assembly from
an internal representation built by the front half of a compiler.
See for example {\it
Introduction to Compilers and Language Design, 2ed} by Douglas
Thain\footnote{You can download the book from http://compilerbook.org}.
This book is not one of those.

The problem with generating assembly is that there are so many of
them. If I showed you how I did it on my computer, you would have
to have a very similar setup to run the output. This is the problem
of portability. My solution to that problem is to provide a tiny
pretend assembly language.

\section{Intro to Pseudo Assembly Language}

My Pseudo Assembly Language (PAL) is designed to give a feel for
writing in assembly and for generating it. It is
tiny, only representating a subset of concepts in a genuine assembly.
It has one assembly directive (to allocate memory for a global
variable) and only 19 instructions total.

PAL is based on a 1970s era assembly, so it is simpler than a modern one.
In those assembly languages each (non-blank) line in the input file is
an instruction that will live sequentially in memory when the program
runs.

We want to start the programs by allocating memory for global variables.
Then we include the instructions that run. Each line can have a label,
which other lines can refer to. They might use the label to jump to
the line or as a kind of variable name to retrieve a value stored there.

%To organize these lines, you need labels. For data, the label becomes
%the name of its location (like a variable name). For instructions it
%becomes the destination of jumps, which we use to implement flow of
%control like if/else or loops. Unconditional jumps have long been considered
%harmful\footnote{See Go To Statement Considered Harmful by Edgar Dijkstra:
%https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf},
%but, in assembly you have nothing else. The key is to be organized
%in their use. Have a rule about when an unconditional jump will be
%used (only to continue a loop, or effect an if/else) and stick to it.
%
%So these are the elements of PAL: labels, allocation of memory,
%and instructions.

Let's see the elements of PAL. After we see them -- and understand how
to write programs by hand -- we will talk about generating PAL from
the language we have been building.

\subsection{Allocation}

The alloc directive sets asside memory. Its one operand is the number of
slots you want. You need multiple slots for arrays.
You have to hard code how many slots your array will use.

You need to label the alloc directive, otherwise you can't refer to that
memory later.

    hours:  alloc 1

Here we see the structure of all statements in PAL:

    an optional label (hours)
    a colon
    an instruction name (alloc)
    at least one space
    one or more space separated operands (1)

\subsection{Memory}

We need a way to put values into allocated memory. PAL provides take
to bring such a value from the keyboard into memory.

    take hours

The only operand for take is the location where the end users value lands
(hours in this case). This will fail unless you have an alloc statement
at the top of the program with this label.

For convenience, you can use the prompt command to print a string telling
your user what your are taking:

    prompt "Enter hours worked -> "

The argument here is a simple string.

If you want to print a value from memory on standard out, use print

    print hours

This takes one label which must be allocated memory. The value in the
variable is what the users sees.

You need to move data to a register in order to perform a calculation
in assembly. Once the register calculation is finished, you need to
put the answer back into memory so the register can be used for later
calculations. Use move to copy values in memory.

    move hours \%regA

I'll say more about the registers later. For now notice that they
are not labeled memory locations. So, they have a syntax to indicate that.
There are six registers. Refer to them as \%regA - %regF.

To see the current state of memory use the shower command which has no
operands.

    shower

This is not a debugger, but it shows the internal data.

\subsection{Arithmetic}

There are four arithmetic operations in PAL: add, subt (subtract),
mult (multiply), and div. Each of these takes a source operand from
memory or a register and a destination register. You can only calculate
in the registers.

    add         3.0     %regC
    subt        40.0    %regB
    mult        1.5     %regA
    div         2.0     %regD

It is traditional in assembly to abbreviate instruction names with three
or four letters. I don't follow that completely in PAL, but it has a
bit of the flavor here.

\subsection{Flow of Control}

If you want to exit a PAL program use end with the exit status like
a C exit statment.

    end 0

In Unix a zero exit status means nothing to report, all went well.
Other numbers indicate errors.

When you get to the bottom of the block for a loop, you don't have
braces or indentation to tell you that. So, you need a jump instruction
to restart the loop's code.

    jump    loopTop

The operand for the jump instruction must be the label of an instruction.

To perform an if, you need one of the branch instructions. There are six
of these, one for each numeric comparison operator.

    breq    leftOperand     rightOperand    desination
    brne    leftOperand     rightOperand    desination
    brge    leftOperand     rightOperand    desination
    brgt    leftOperand     rightOperand    desination
    brle    leftOperand     rightOperand    desination
    brlt    leftOperand     rightOperand    desination

The instruction indicates the desired comparison. So, breq tests
for equality, brne for the opposite, brge >=, brgt >, brle <=,
and brlt <.

That operator is used between the leftOperand and the rightOperand
which can be registers, literal numbers, or memory locations.
The destination must be an instruction label (or the integer
line number of an instruction) to jump to if the condition is met.

Consider

    brgt    40.0    hours   overtime

This say branch to the line labeled overtime when 40.0 is greater
that the value in the allocated memory labeled hours. 

Finally, you can call a subroutine. This is primative, even more
so that in a real assembly. Before your make the call, you need
to arrange values in memory that the destination is expecting.
If it needs to return a value to you, it must put it in an agreed
upon location.

                gosub   subLabel
    ...
    subLabel:   ...
                ret

The gosub instruction has a single operand which is the address of
the line where the subroutine starts. This can be a label, or anything
that has the line number (for example a memory location).

That is the complete list of instructions in PAL.

\section{Example PAL Programs Part I}

Let's look at some example programs the above makes possible

\subsection{Compute Gross Pay}

With what have seen so far, we can write a program to compute
gross pay for an hourly working earning overtime for hours over 40.

    hrs:        alloc   1
    rate:       alloc   1
    pay:        alloc   1

                prompt  "Enter hours worked -> "
                take    hrs
                prompt  "Enter pay per hour -> "
                take    rate
                brgt    hrs     40.0    overtime
    regular:    move    hrs     %regA
                mult    rate    %regA
                move    %regA   pay
                jump    finish
    overtime:   move    40.0    %regA
                mult    rate    %regA
                move    hrs     %regB
                subt    40.0    %regB
                mult    rate    %regB
                mult    1.5     %regB
                add     %regB   %regA
                move    %regA   pay
    finish:     prompt  "Gross Pay:"
                prt     pay

Explanation, step by step. The first three lines allocate variables:
hrs (for how much the employee worked), rate (for how many dollars
per hour they earn), and pay to hold their gross pay (the answer).

Blank lines are legal and ignored. PAL does not support comments.

The next four lines take data from the keyboard into hrs and rate.
Prompt statements tell the user what to enter. Take statements store
what they enter in the labeled location.

This program assumes time-and-a-half for hours above 40. The brgt
statement tests hrs > 40. If that is true, it jumps to the line
labeled overtime. Otherwise, it falls through. The regular label
is not referenced, but serves as documentation for the programmer.

For hours under fourty, it is enough to put the hrs into register A,
multiply that by the rate, then move the result to pay. Then we need
to jump over the overtime block to finish. This is typical, we
use jumps at the end of a set of instructions to avoid performing
the blocks for both if and else. (Note that if you think of brgt
as an if statement, the first block is actually for the else case.)

In overtime we have more work to do. First, put a literal 40
into register A and multiply that by the rate. Then move the
total hours into register B, subtract fourty from that, multiply
by the rate, and again by 1.5. Finally, add register B (the overtime
pay) to register A (the base pay for fourty hours), and move
the result to the pay location.

In either case, we arrive at the finish lable. Either because of the
jump after doing the under fourty calculation or because we fell
through the end of the overtime code. This prints a label and then
the answer.

To run this, put it in a file called payroll.pal and execute

    gradle build
    java -jar build/lib/pal.jar payroll.pal
    42
    12

The you should see

    Gross Pay:
    516.0

\subsection{Factorial}

We have the ability to call subroutines recursively in PAL. Consdier
this program that computes factorial.

    n:         alloc      1
    original   alloc      1
    answer:    alloc      1

               prompt     "Enter and integer n, I'll find n! ->"
               take       n
               move       n       original
               move       1.0     %regB
               gosub      fact
               move       %regB   answer
               prompt     "Factorial of"
               prt        original
               prompt     "is"
               prt        answer
               end        0
    fact:      brle       n     1.0     base
               mult       n     %regB
               move       n     %regA
               subt       1.0   %regA
               move       %regA n
               gosub      fact
    base:      ret

Recall that 5! is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2, which is 120.
If I run this program, that is what I should see as the final output.

    build gradle
    java -jar build/lib/pal.jar factorial.pal
    Enter and integer n, I'll find n! ->
    5
    Factorial of
    5.0
    is
    120.0

\section{Emitting PAL}

Now that we have a working knowledge of PAL, we can emit it from
our expression language.

\subsection{Register Management}

As with many assembly languages, PAL has a limited number of registers
(admittedly in PAL this could be rectified without changing a silicon
chip fabrication). In particular, there are six registers named
\%regA - \%regF.

At the beginning of emission, we need to create a list of free registers.
When a node wants to use a register, it will request one from the free
list. Then, when it is done with it, put it back. There are many ways
to manage a free list. My way is with a stack.

In PALEvalVisitor, I used these methods to make all of that possible.

    private Stack<String> initRegisters() {
        Stack<String> answer = new Stack<>();
        String[] names = new String[] {
            "%regD",
            "%regC",
            "%regB",
            "%regA",
        };
        Arrays.stream(names).forEach(name -> answer.push(name));

        return answer;
    }

Notice that I only added four of the six registers to the free list.
We probably don't need more. I chose this number because x86 assembly
on my Linux system had four convenient integer registers, so I stuck
with that number.

The constructor calls this in addition to building the symbol table.

    Map<String, Integer> symbolTable;
    Stack<String> freeRegisters;

    public PALEvalVisitor() {
        symbolTable = new HashMap<>();
        freeRegisters = initRegisters();
    }

    public String getFreeRegister() {
        if (freeRegisters.empty()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("No available registers.");
        }
        return freeRegisters.pop();
    }

When an emitting routine wants a register, it calls getFreeRegister.
It must be a steward of that register, using it for its purpose and
putting it back when finished.

    public void freeRegister(String register) {
        freeRegisters.push(register);
    }

When that faithful stewardship is finishing, the emitter calls freeRegister
to return the register to the free list.

\subsection{Emitting}

In the top level PALEvalVisitor we need an emit method to drive the process.

    public String emit(Node program) {
        String programEmission = program.emit(null);

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(emitSymbolTable() + "\n");

        sb.append(programEmission);

        return sb.toString();
    }

First, it calls emit on the node passed to it by the runner. That will
be a ProgramNode and we could insist on that here.

    public String emit(ProgramNode program) {...}

Note that it needs to store the emissions from the tree nodes from
program to all of its descendents. Only after they have generated
their output will it have the symbol table ready for memory allocation.

    private String emitSymbolTable() {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String symbol : symbolTable.keySet()) {
            sb.append(symbol + ": alloc 1\n");
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

We must emit the symbol table first, memory must be allocated before
it is used in PAL. In other assemblies, this order is also required
because modern safety requirements prevent mixing data and code. Data
comes in the first segment.

The version of Node now requires that subclasses implement emit with
an optional register. This allows parents to pass a register to their
children.

    public abstract class Node {
        public abstract void act();
        public abstract String emit(String register);
        public abstract Integer getIntValue();
    }

To simplify things, I have returned to an integer version of the language.
Feel free to expand on this to allow types including functions.

Now each Node will implement emit. The IdNode and IntNode will move
their values into the register supplied by their parent expression.

    public class IdNode extends Node {
        ...
        @Override
        public String emit(String register) {
            return "move " + symbol + " " + register + "\n";
        }
        ...
    }

    public class IntNode extends Node {
        ...
        @Override
        public String emit(String register) {
            return "move " + value + ".0 " + register + "\n";
        }
        ...
    }

Note that PAL only supports floats and its literal numbers must include
a decimal point and at least one number after it. Even though the source
language only does integer math, the target supports only floating point
math. Such is the nature of life.

When we print, we need the children of the expression to emit enough
PAL to calculate their values, leaving them in a register from which we
actually print.

    public class PrintNode extends Node {
        @Override
        public String emit(String ignoredRegister) {
            String register = treeHelper.getFreeRegister();

            String childEmission = valueNode.emit(register);

            String myEmission = "prt " + register + "\n";

            treeHelper.freeRegister(register);

            return childEmission + myEmission;
        }
    }

This requires retrieving a free register for the top level expression node
to use for its answer. We get that from the getFreeRegister method
of PALEvalVisitor shown earlier. Notice that we hold onto the register
from giving it to the child expression through emitting the actual
prt command. Then, we must free it so others can use it. Otherwise we
will soon run out of registers.

Each of the calculation Nodes is highly similar. I will only show emit
for AddNode.

    public class AddNode extends Node {
        @Override
        public String emit(String register) {
            String leftRegister = treeHelper.getFreeRegister();
            // right register is the one that was given to me
            String leftEmission = left.emit(leftRegister);
            String rightEmission = right.emit(register);

            String myEmission = "add " + leftRegister + " " + register + "\n";

            treeHelper.freeRegister(leftRegister);

            return leftEmission + rightEmission + myEmission;
        }
    }

Some parent expression will be calling this method passing it a final
destination register. The right child can use that, since the final
result for the right child is needed here and can hold the final
answer of addition. But, the left child expression needs a different
register. So, we again call getFreeRegister on our PALEvalVisitor instance.
At the end, we free that register. We do not free the right register,
since our parent will use it for our result and then free it.

\subsection{Tidiness}

You can spend as much or as little time as you like on formatting generated
code. When gcc generates assembly, we generally don't care what it looks like.
But, while you are working on the generator, proper indentation and
some extra whitespace can be really valuable. Feel free to tidy the emissions.

Exercise

1. Add support for floating point numbers either by switching to them
   or by supporting both int and float types.

2. Add support for functions to the emission scheme.

3. Add indentation and column alignment of the emitted code.

% If we get to arrays
%\section{Addressing Modes}
%
%Arrays in assembly are a challenge. For them we need more than just
%move with either literal numbers or labels. We want addresses and
%pointers. For these we use addressing modes.
