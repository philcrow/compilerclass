Parsing PAL with Antlr4

Make a grammar file called PAL.g4

Make sure you have the current directory and antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar
in the CLASSPATH.

Write a script or Makefile to do these steps in order:
    1. java -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar PAL.g4 -o build
    2. cd build; javac *.java
I still need to figure out how to get the package instruction to antrl4 to
make the usual Java directory tree.

Make an alias for grun:
    alias grun='java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'

Then you need to be in the build directory to test with:

    cd build
    grun PAL program -gui ../../payroll.pal

This builds and displays the parse tree based on the generated lexer/parser
pair. It also makes an interface for walking PALListener.java and an
implementation PALBaseListener.java so we can inherit and replace the
methods we care about.

We also need a main method to deliver the file to the parser.

PACKAGING?

suggests a basic gradle approach
