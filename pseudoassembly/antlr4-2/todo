Go back and see which nodes really need the interpretter.
Hint: only the ones that are going to manipulate the program pointer,
not the ones that are just using operands.
OR, rethink the collaboration. Currently everyone needs the interpretter,
but it would be nicer if only those needing to modiy the program pointer did.

PALOperand.resolveDest should really be resolveLocation

Should the interpretter be offering storeValue? I'm not sure.

The operand should be offering to store in itself.

command act
    alloc     : 'alloc' INT ;
    add       : 'add' operand operand ;
    branch    : operator operand operand operand;
    div       : 'div' operand operand ;
    end       : 'end' INT ;
    jump      : 'jump' operand;
    multiply  : 'mult' operand operand ;
    prompt    : 'prompt' STRING ;
    print     : 'prt' operand+ ;
    move      : 'move' operand operand ;
    subtract  : 'subt' operand operand ;
    take      : 'take' operand ;
shower    : 'shower' ;
    gosub     : 'gosub' operand ;
    return    : 'ret' ;
