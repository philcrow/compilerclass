See pop.jflex.l, it seems to be working.

To get output:
jflex pop.jflex.l    # makes Lexer.java (the name is in the %class request)
It looks like you would need a driver with these features:
    a main method
    instantiate a Reader
    pass that to to Lexer constructor
    loop until yylex returns null
