There are usually two sides to technology: using it and working on it.
Loosely, I call this driver's ed vs. auto shop. In the former we learn
to operate a car: parking, signaling, turning, minding the rules of the
road. In the latter we would learn to repair the various systems on
a car. Notice I say ``would learn.'' I've never taken auto shop. My
repair skills are limited. This is typical. More people need to know
how to operate a car than need to know how to work on it.

For the expert, shop is more interesting. The temptation to fixate on it
is strong. This definitely holds for books and courses about compilers.
This book takes the driver's ed approach exclusively. It is completely
distinterested in how finite automata and context free grammars work
theoretically and how they are implemented. Our goal will be to use
tools to make languages.

The main tool of this course is ANTLR4 which was written by Terence Parr.
He wrote an excellent book about it called The Definitive ANTLR4 Reference.
You will probably want to consult that, or the various forms of online
documentation including especially antlr.org.

You can use ANTLR4 with various languages including C, C#, JavaScript,
and Python. Here we will use Java for the simple fact that I know
it well enough. If you are going to follow along, choose a language
that is comfortable for you.

Let's get started.
